# react-coin
First react app

### Running
To run the application
`
npm run start
`
and hit http://localhost:3000

### Building
To do prod build
`
npm run build
`

## Installing Static Server
To install static server
`
npm i -g serve
`

### Serving as a normal app
To start the static server & publish build app
`
serve build
`
and hit http://localhost:5000


The main disadvantage with this is if you hit homepage & navigate to all other pages, it will work fine. Instead if you try to hit other pages like http://localhost:5000/currency/bitcoin first, then it will through 404 error. We can either use `HashRouter` instead of `BroswerRouter` or can run application as Single Page Application (SPA) to fix this.

### Serving as a SPA
To run application as SPA  
`
serve -s build
`

Now we can hit any page in the application and it will be served properly without throwing 404 error.

## Installing Dynamic Server
To install dynamic server 'express'
`npm i express --save`

### Serving app on dynamic server
Run command `node server.js` and hit http://localhost:9000 

## Installing in Heroku
### Creating app in Heroku
Use command

`
heroku create react-coin3 --buildpack https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git
`

in the location of the project. You will receive message as

```
Creating â¬¢ react-coin3... done
Setting buildpack to https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git... done
https://react-coin3.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/react-coin3.git
```

Now, the url allocated to our application is https://react-coin3.herokuapp.com/ and you will receive default welcome page if you hit it now
